How to use our model :


1.	First import all libraries  which are required for run our code.    
2.	 Import  Intent.json file for traing model.
        format of intent.json file : 
            {
          "intents": [
			 {
                "tag": "google",
           		 "patterns": [ ],
               "responses": [ ]
            }
     }
3.	Run all cells on any python supported IDE.
